	<p>Cats are better than dogs. Usually, cats are much more cute than dogs. They will not get so angry like dogs, and also they will not bark as dogs. Some actions from them are quite interesting, like using the paws to tease their own fur, it just like a child. That's an interesting movement on cats. </p>
